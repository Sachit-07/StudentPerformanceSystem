## 📌 Features & Concepts Implemented
- **Classes & Objects**
- **Default Arguments**
- **Constructors (Default & Parameterized)**
- **Function Overloading**
- **Unary & Binary Operator Overloading**
- **Multilevel Inheritance**
- **Multiple Inheritance**
- **Input Validation (error handling)**
- **Subject-wise Reports**
- **Class Teacher Reports**

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run
1. Save the program file as `main.cpp`
2. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the file’s folder  
3. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o student_system
4. Run:
   bash
       ./student_system


📝 Example Flow
Enter student ID, name, subject marks, and attendance.

Teacher can view combined performance reports for a subject across different classes.

Program validates input and handles errors gracefully.

📖 Description
C++ Student Performance Management System demonstrating OOP concepts like constructors, function & operator overloading, inheritance, default arguments, and validation. Manages student marks, attendance, and teacher subject reports with error handling in a single program.



Developed as part of BCA coursework.
